# Week 1

##
This week I chose the topic and language for the project. I browsed through the possible topics on the Moodle page, and immediately knew I would want to make some sort of a game.
I decided to embark upon creating an AI for solving for the popular game 2048. I have been an avid player of the game for years, and it would be interesting to go into detail with the inner workings of the game. 

I created the github repository for the project, allowed the creation of issues, and registered on Labtool. I have also started writing the project specification document. The program will be written in the programming language Python. 

With regard to future directions, next week I will first implement the core functionalities of the game - creation of the board; movements left, right, up, and down; random insertion of numbers. After this, I will work on creating an efficient solver for the game, most likely using a variation of the minmax algorithm - expectimax - and transposition tables to avoid duplication. 

Time spent this week: 2 hours.
